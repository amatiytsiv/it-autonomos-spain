## Obtaining a plastic SIP for yourself

If you do not have a permanent plastic SIP, you can get one after registering as an autónomo.

**Method #1**

The most reliable method. After registering as an autónomo (it’s better to wait a few days), take your documents and go
to the nearest Centro de Salud. You don’t need cita.

Tell them you want to get a plastic SIP card. They will likely be able to see in their system that you are an autónomo
and registered with Seguridad Social. If so, they will issue the plastic SIP card right away (it is printed on the
spot). However, there may be a situation where they ask for additional documents or request you to fill out some form.

**Method #2**

This was very simple for me, but judging by messages in the chat, this option rarely works for others. A few days after
registering as an autónomo, I received an SMS stating that my plastic SIP card was ready. I went to my Centro de Salud 
(where I previously registered for the paper SIP) and exchanged my paper SIP for a plastic one in just 2 minutes.

**Method #3**

1. Obtain a certificate of entitlement to healthcare (derecho de asistencia
   sanitaria) [here](https://pssc.seg-social.es/pssc-app-estructurados/asistencia){:target="_blank"}. To learn how to
   obtain it, it’s better to ask in the chat (I’m not duplicating the instructions here because it’s quite big).
2. Print your empadronamiento from the ayuntamiento's website.
3. Go to the Centro de Salud in your area, show all these documents, and receive a plastic SIP card.
